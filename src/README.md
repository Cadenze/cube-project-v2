# Cube Project v2

## The long-awaited sequel to the Cube Project

### Project Description

We aim to write a comprehensive program
that allows us to do almost everything 3x3 Rubik's cube related.
This includes:
- generating solves
- use as a primitive cube timer
- solving cubes using the CFOP method
- solving cubes using Kociemba's algorithm

This combines the work done in T2-cube,
which was the basis of Cube Project v1,
and the work done in CPSC 210,
which helped with the development of certain utilities.

### Main Project Goals

- [ ] Rewrite cube structure
- [ ] Human solution (CFOP with search)
- [ ] Half Kociemba (*a* solution)
- [ ] Three-quarters Kociemba (*the* solution)
- [ ] Full Kociemba (efficiency upgrade)

### Side Project Goals

- [ ] Metric/statistics
- [ ] Timer
- [ ] Scrambler
- [ ] CLI
- [ ] GUI
